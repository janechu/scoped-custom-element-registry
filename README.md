# Scoped Custom Element Registry

This is just a little testing area, if on MacOS the scoped custom elements are available under a flag, download Chrome Canary and run `open -a "Google Chrome Canary" --args --enable-features=ScopedCustomElementRegistry` to try it out.

The repository will likely be short lived as it's merely a stub to try some of the new APIs.

## Requirements

- NodeJS
- npm

## Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
